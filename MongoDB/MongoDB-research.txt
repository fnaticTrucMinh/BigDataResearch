* Why mongoDB 
	- Offering massive increases in productivity by allowing us to store data in a way that is consistent with how we think and create applications
	- Giving us the confidence and freedom to concentrate on differentiating code without having to be concerned about challenges associated with data locality, reliability and scalability
	- Running consistently all the way from local development environments to the largest mainframe deployments
	- Database can be deployed on-premises, in a hybrid cloud, or in any of the public clouds
* Introduction 
	1/ It is an 'open-source' "DOCUMENT DATABASE" that provides :
			+ High performance
			+ High availability
			+ Automatic scaling.
		1.1 Document database : 
			+ A record in MongoDB is a document
			+ A data structure composed of field and value pairs
			+ Similar to JSON objects
			*DAdv : 
				__Documents (i.e. objects) correspond to native data types in many programming languages.
				__Embedded documents and arrays reduce need for expensive joins.
				__Dynamic schema supports fluent polymorphism.
		1.2 Key features
			+ High performance
				__Support for embedded data models reduces I/O activity on database system.
				__Indexes support faster queries and can include keys from embedded documents and arrays.
			+ Rich Query Language
				.Read and write operations (CRUD) as well as:
				__Data Aggregation
				__Text Search and Geospatial Queries.
			+ High Availability
				.MongoDBâ€™s replication facility, called replica set, provides:
				__automatic failover 
				__data redundancy
				.A replica set is a group of MongoDB servers that maintain the same data set, providing redundancy and increasing data availability.
			+ Horizontal Scalability (part of its core functionality)
				__Sharding distributes data across a cluster of machines.
			+ Support for Multiple Storage Engines
				__WiredTiger Storage Engine (including support for Encryption at Rest)
				__In-Memory Storage Engine
				__MMAPv1 Storage Engine
				__Providing pluggable storage engine API that allows third parties to develop storage engines for MongoDB
