"React is a JavaScript library for building User Interfaces"

React is a library for building composable user interfaces. 
Reusable UI components
Present data that changes over time
The V in MVC. 
One-way reactive data flow


__ Features:

    JSX − JSX is JavaScript syntax extension. It isn't necessary to use JSX in React development, but it is recommended.

    Components − React is all about components. You need to think of everything as a component. This will help you maintain the code when working on larger scale projects.

    Unidirectional data flow and Flux − React implements one-way data flow which makes it easy to reason about your app. Flux is a pattern that helps keeping your data unidirectional.

__ JSX:

    React uses a special syntax called JSX, which allows you to mix HTML with JavaScript.
    React turns those bits of HTML into functions with a special JSXTransformer.

__ Component:

    React gives you the ability to create your own components that you can later reuse, combine, and nest to your heart’s content.
    In React, we describe User Interfaces using components. You can think of components as simple functions (in any programming language).

__ Virtual DOM 

Flexibility
Efficient 
Amazing performance


__ Adv vs DAdv:
     # Adv

    Uses virtual DOM which is a JavaScript object. This will improve apps performance, since JavaScript virtual DOM is faster than the regular DOM.

    Can be used on client and server side as well as with other frameworks.

    Component and data patterns improve readability, which helps to maintain larger apps.

     # DAdv:

    Covers only the view layer of the app, hence you still need to choose other technologies to get a complete tooling set for development.

    Uses inline templating and JSX, which might seem awkward to some developers.


__ Reasons why React has become so popular so quickly:

    Working with the DOM API is hard. React basically gives developers the ability to work with a virtual browser that is more friendly than the real browser. React’s virtual browser acts like an agent between the developer and the real browser.

    React enables developers to declaratively describe their User Interfaces and model the state of those interfaces. This means instead of coming up with steps to describe transactions on interfaces, developers just describe the interfaces in terms of a final state (like a function). When transactions happen to that state, React takes care of updating the User Interfaces based on that.

    React is just JavaScript, there is a very small API to learn, just a few functions and how to use them. After that, your JavaScript skills are what make you a better React developer. There are no barriers to entry. A JavaScript developer can become a productive React developer in a few hours.
